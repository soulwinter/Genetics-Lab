# Genetics Lab

>  Participate in the **WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge** project. Built entirely with SwiftUI.

The name of my project is Genetics Lab, and the goal is to help people learn the most basic and simple principles of genetics through visual models and hands-on practice. We all learned about genetics in biology class in high school, and because it takes so long to go from planting seeds to harvesting, there are very few experiments on genetics in the classroom.

So my project simulates genetic experiments by growing different types of tomatoes and crossing them to observe their offspring traits; and by using SwiftUI animations to visualize the genetic process so that users can understand more clearly how it all happens.

There are many tomato varieties built into the app for you to choose from. Through the app, you will learn what kind of tomatoes are produced when you cross a red round tomato with a yellow pear-shaped tomato; and at the end you will have the freedom to practice your own combinations and breed your own tomato varieties.

There are 5 chapters in the app. The first two chapters demonstrate the law of segregation in genetics through hands-on and visual animations; chapters 3 and 4 demonstrate the law of independent assortment; and the final chapter incorporates all the previous knowledge and leaves you free to play with it.

The entire App is built with the latest version of SwiftUI, using basic Drag & Drop techniques and simple animations.
